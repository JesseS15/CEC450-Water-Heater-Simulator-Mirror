# CEC450-Capstone-Project (RTS)

Project Proposal:

The objective of this assignment was to simulate the operation of a hot water tank in a real-time environment using VxWorks/WindRiver. 
The project is a hot water tank simulator used to imitate the behavior of an automatic water tank monitoring system. There are several sensors and actuators involved in controlling the water level and the temperature in a tank. The user is able to input temperature and water level ranges which initalize the system. Once initalized, the program runs in real-time, updating and outputting the current tank water level, pressure, temperature, and status of the inlet and outlet valves.

Project will use C in the VxWorks/WindRiver enviroment.
